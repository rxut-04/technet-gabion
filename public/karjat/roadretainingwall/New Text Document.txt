We successfully completed a road retaining wall installation at Karjat, aimed at reinforcing the roadside and preventing soil erosion and collapse. Constructed using heavy-duty gabion baskets filled with durable stones, the wall ensures long-term stability and safety for nearby infrastructure. The project was completed on time and within budget, blending structural strength with a natural appearance.
