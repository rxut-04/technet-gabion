We successfully completed a gabion wall installation at Karjat, designed for effective erosion control and structural support. The wall features high-quality galvanized steel baskets filled with durable stones, offering both strength and a natural aesthetic. Completed on time and within budget, the project enhances the site's stability while blending seamlessly with the environment.
