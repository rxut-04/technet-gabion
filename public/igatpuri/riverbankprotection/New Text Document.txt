We successfully completed a gabion wall installation for river bank protection at Igatpuri, aimed at preventing erosion and enhancing bank stability. The structure features galvanized steel gabion baskets filled with durable stones, ensuring long-term performance and a natural appearance. Delivered on schedule and within budget, the project provides reliable protection while complementing the surrounding landscape.
